# Programming-Concept
<H4>
  This is a video game that we are developing for an assignment.  Programme is 100% C++ and also a console application. Haven't used any OOP concepts. inside the game
   there are three levels. If you want to move to the next levels, you have to achieve the score target at the certain level. When you moving towards throughout the levels it's get much harder than before. We implemented the code by adding,
   <ol>
    <li> High Score Table </li>
    <li> Background Music </li>
    <li> Lives()
